In order to start my database, run the “Dump” file titled MusicLibraryDumpNikolicJ. After my schema has been created, you can run the application code titled NikolicJMusicLibraryApplication. This is a pynb file and I completed this application code using python in Jupyter Notebook. I imported libraries logging, getpass, mysql.connector and Error from mysql.connector. After the application code is run, the user is prompted to enter their username and password, then select the desired operation by entering the associated number.
